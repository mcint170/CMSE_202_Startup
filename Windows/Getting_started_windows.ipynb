These shortcuts are called *aliases*. However, fortunately we have a script (`.sh` is the file ending) that will make those edits for you. *Note: IF YOU HAVE ANACONDA INSTALLED ON UBUNTU (not shown in this tutorial), these shortcuts will not work as these alias names are already in use and will not work.

To do this we will create what is known as an `alias` in your `.bashrc` file that links to this folder. An `alias` is a fancy name for a \"text shortcut\" that can be used in the terminal. The `.bashrc` is a settings file that your terminal uses to customize your terminal experince.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up the Ubuntu terminal, and type `cd ~` and press `Enter` to make sure you are at your home directory (`~`). This command will \"change your directory\" (`cd`) to the home directory.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the C drive and go to the `Users` Directory. \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/users.png\" alt=\"users\" width=\"500\"/> Type the command `cd /mnt/c/Users` and press `Enter`. This \"changes directory\" (`cd`) to the `Users` directory/folder. Notice the `/mnt/c` means that you are now in the `c` drive. The `c` drive is the drive that Windows 10 is installed, meaning that from this point on you will be accessing files that are accessible on Windows 10.\n",
    "3. Print the directory/folder contents and navigate to the folder that is your Username.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/users_ls.png\" alt=\"users_ls\" width=\"500\"/>  Type `ls` and press `Enter`. In the terminal you will see a list of folders and files. Notice that there is a folder that has your Username for Windows. In my case this is `nodnarb13`.   \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/user_home.png\" alt=\"user_home\" width=\"500\"/>  Using your username you will need to type `cd [USERNAME]` where in place of `[USERNAME]` you put the username you determined for last step. In the case of my computer this would be `cd nodnarb13`. Note as well you have a space in your username there may be `''` around your name.  \n",
    "4. Save the path to the User directory, and navigate back to the Home directory.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/pwd.png\" alt=\"pwd\" width=\"500\"/>  In the terminal type `pwd`. Then copy the results of the command by clicking and dragging over the text and pressing <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> c </kbd> to copy the highlighted text. If successful the text should become un-highlighted.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/cd_home.png\" alt=\"cd_home\" width=\"500\"/> Go back to the Home directory by typing `cd ~` and pressing `Enter`. This will take you back to the home directory, which you can verify checking your location is at `~`.  \n",
    "5. Add an `alias` to `.bashrc` for the User Folder path we just copied.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/vim_bashrc.png\" alt=\"vim_bashrc\" width=\"500\"/>  In the terminal type `vi .bashrc`. This will open up the `.bashrc` file in a command line text editor called Vim.  \n",

Then on your keyboard press the up-arrow key <kbd> ↑ </kbd> once to move to the newly created blank line. Then type `alias win_usr='cd `. Using your mouse , in the terminal window *right-click* this should then paste the path you copied earlier to line you are typing on. Then finally type `'`. If all went well you should have `alias win_usr='cd [PATH_YOU_PASTED]'`. In my case this looks like `alias win_usr='cd /mnt/c/Users/nonarb13`.  *Note: If any of the lines besides the one you just created were altered, this could break things. Make sure you did not alter any other lines before continuing. If you did happen to mess them up, press `Esc` on the keyboard and then type `:q!` and press `Enter` this will not save any of the changes you made, and you can try editing `.bashrc` again.*\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/save.png\" alt=\"save\" width=\"500\"/>  To save and close the file we will need to return back to the \"Command Mode\" to do this press the `Esc` on your keyboard. You will notice the bottom left-hand corner will go from `-- INSERT --` to *blank*. Then type on your keyboard `:wq` and press enter. This is the command to save (or *write* to the disk `w`) and to quit the text editor (`q`).  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/source.png\" alt=\"source\" width=\"500\"/>  In the terminal, type `source .bashrc` and press `Enter`. This will apply the changes we made to the file. If you encounter an error it is most likely you did not close your `'` in your alias. You can reopen the file again with `vi .bashrc` and check to see if you spot an error.  \n",
    "6. Test the alias.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/win_usr.png\" alt=\"win_usr\" width=\"500\"/>  In the terminal try out the command by typing `win_usr` and pressing `Enter`. If all went well you will notice your location change to the appropiate folder.  \n",
    "    ![ls_usr](./images/ls_usr.png)  As stated earlier this folder has lots of important and useful folders in it that may come in handy later.

    "**Using Windows Terminal as main Terminal**  \n",
    "The Ubuntu Terminal works well as a terminal, however, sometimes you may want to run multiple instances (or windows) of the terminal or sometimes even run a powershell or command line terminal. Such an example is when you are a running Jupyter Notebook process (which locks up the terminal until the Jupyter Notebook process is stoped), but you also want to perform actions on the terminal such as creating and moving files. This would require you to open another Ubuntu terminal, which is not hard, but requires mutliple clicks and keystrokes and will produce yet another window you have to juggle around. When using Windows Terminal, opening another terminal is a simple as clicking one button and the terminals will become tabs making window management easy. This section will take you through how to setup Windows Terminal to work well with WSL and make terminal window management a little easier.\n",

There you will have the option to select Ubuntu. Click that option.   \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/winterm_pwd.png\" alt=\"winterm_pwd\" width=\"500\"/> Now we can use WSL built in ability to run powershell in order to grab the Windows path that we need. In this terminal type `cd ~` go to WSL's home directory. Then type `powershell.exe -c \"pwd\"` to use powershell to print the home directory through the Windows path.

Then you will need to create a newline underneath that by pressing `Enter` at the end of the \"source\" line. You will notice that then moving to the new line it will start at the beginning of the line on the left. In order to get the correct indentation you will need to press the `Tab` key twice. Then in the new line you will need to add the following: `\"startingDirectory\": \"[PATH]\"`. Where the `[PATH]` is the Windows Path we got earlier in our Ubuntu Terminal. The Path is the highlighted part in the image above (`\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-20.04\\home\\bmcin`). It starts with `\\\\wsl$` and will need to be copied exactly into the settings.

To do this use the arrow-keys to move along the text, and change all back-slashes `\\` to `/` forward-slashes. Then change `C:` to lowercase `/c`. Then you should have the correct alias.\n",

The paths may vary by system if you saved Anaconda3 not in the default spot the Anaconda Installer suggested.

    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/a11.png\" alt=\"Add\" width=\"500\"/>  You will notice that the path from `where python` returns a path that has \"Anaconda3\" in the path. `C:\\Users\\bmcin\\anaconda3\\python.exe`. What you will want to do is copy everything up to \"anaconda3\" (`C:\\Users\\bmcin\\anaconda3`). Then press the `New` button and then paste the path in there.

    "    <img src=\"./images/a12.png\" alt=\"source\" width=\"500\"/>  In the Git Bash terminal, type and enter `source .bashrc`. This will apply the changes we made earlier to the file. If you encounter an error in this part or the next part, it is most likely you did not close your `'` in your alias, you did not put a `/` in front of the `c`, or you spelled something wrong.

Again, you will notice the screen will flash if you are try pressing the right-arrow while at the end of the line. Then, on the keyboard press `Enter` and this should make a newline. Type `cd ~`. If done successfully, the file should look like this. *Note: if any of the lines above the `cd ~` were altered, this could break things. Make sure you did not alter any of those lines before continuing. If you did happen to mess them up, press `Esc` on the keyboard and then type `:q!` and press `Enter` this will not save any of the changes you made, and you can try editing it again.*\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/close_vim.png\" alt=\"close_vim\" width=\"500\"/>  To save and close the file we will need to return back to the \"Command Mode\" to do this press the `Esc` on your keyboard. You will notice the bottom left-hand corner will go from `-- INSERT --` to *blank*. Then type on your keyboard `:wq` and press `Enter`. This is the command to save (or *write* to the disk `w`) and to quit the text editor (`q`).\n",

Making sure we know where we are at is crucial to this process. When Opening Git Bash it is likely you will start in one of two places. Either the root directory signified by `/` or your home directory signified by `~`. If you followed the instructions in the `Changing startup location to Home directory` you should always load into the Home (`~`) directory. In this course, we will never need to do anything with the root (`/`) directory as this is a where important files for Git Bash live. To see where you start up in a more familiar program, we will be utilizng the Windows file explorer command inside of the Git Bash terminal.\n",

Here you can navigate the folder and see all that you can access from your Home directory. Try to see if you can figure out how to navigate to this spot from other locations. This will be important if you need to open a file in programs such as `spyder`. If you run into issues in the future in trying to find this folder, make sure to as your Instructors or LA for help! \n",

    "We will be using Slack ([http://slack.com](http://slack.com)) as our means of communicating about course content as the semester progresses. We believe that this will provide an excellent avenue to have discussions not only with course instructors, TAs, and LAs, but also between you and your fellow classmates. In order to join the Slack team that we’ve created for the course you should complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [https://cmse-courses.slack.com/signup](https://cmse-courses.slack.com/signup)\n",
    "2. Once there, sign up using your @msu.edu email address.\n",

    "Once you've joined the CMSE Courses Slack team, you'll need to **add yourself to two channels**. The first channel you should add yourself to is **\"cmse202-f20-help\"**. The second one you should add yourself to is **\"cmse202-###-f20\"** where \"###\" corresponds to the section of the course that you are enrolled in. To add yourself to these channels, click on \"Channels\" and search for the appropriate channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"help\" channel will be the place to go for any questions about assignments in the course or issues you're having with your computer or Python. We encourage you to help out other classmates when you can! The section-specific channel will be used by your instructor for important messages relevant only to your section of the course.\n",

    "### Slack usage rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that Slack is a useful tool that does not become overly time-consuming for the course instructors, TAs, or LAs, we have a list of rules for how we expect you to use Slack. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before you ask a question, be sure to check the other section channels to see if the question has already been answered.\n",
    "2. The Slack team is primarily for you, the students, so help each other.\n",
    "3. The TAs and LAs will monitor the channels, but will defer to the students to work through things. They will only enter a conversation if students are going down the wrong path and/or there are too few other students involved. However, you should not expect that the TAs or LAs will always be available. The TAs and LAs will spend a limited amount of time “logged in” to Slack and we ask that you be respectful of their time.\n",
    "4. Slack is meant to be used to help you when you are stuck with a minor issue. If you are having major issues or trouble understanding the concept, go to office/helproom hours.  Office/helproom hours are meant for more in-depth discussions of course content.\n",
    "5. Course instructors will rarely check Slack, only to examine progress. While they may offer help, do not rely on it. Instructors will not respond to the same student twice within a 30 minute time interval.\n",
    "6. Only in rare cases should you contact an instructor through a private channel. But, if you are struggling, feel free to use this option.\n",
    "7. **Do not** post your solutions to out-of-class assignments directly into Slack unless prompted by an instructor.\n",
    "8. Be courteous to everyone on Slack. Students who are being rude or who are excessively posting might be banned from posting on the course Slack channel."
