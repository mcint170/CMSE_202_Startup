    "# Installing Python for this Course\n",
    "You need to have a functioning and **current** Anaconda Python installation on your computer for this course. If you have a past installation, you are expected to make sure it is up-to-date. In addition to making sure your installation is updated, you should also ensure that the Anaconda installation is in your default path.\n",

    "***NOTE 1: If you had Anaconda installed previous to updating to macOS Catalina (Released October 7, 2019) or beyond, your installation is most likely broken. There is a way to [repair](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/how-to-restore-anaconda-after-macos-catalina-update) Anaconda but this is experimental and quite a bit of work. It is much easier to just reinstall  Anaconda. Follow this section [here](#catalina) if this applies to you.***  \n",

    "2. Open up the terminal and download `anconda-clean`\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/install_clean.png\" alt=\"install_clean\" width=\"500\"/> Using Spotlight by pressing <kbd> command </kbd> + <kbd> space-bar </kbd> or simply use the search bar in the top right corner search `terminal` and press `Enter`.

    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/install_y.png\" alt=\"install_y\" width=\"500\"/> To continue type `y` and press enter.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/run_clean.png\" alt=\"run_clean\" width=\"500\"/> Type in the terminal `anaconda-clean --yes` and press `Enter`. (or you can run it without the `--yes`, but will have to agree to each deletion.)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/clean_done.png\" alt=\"clean_done\" width=\"500\"/> If all goes well you should not encounter any errors. This process deleted some anaconda files, but there are still some more to delete.  \n",
    "3. Delete the `.anaconda_backup`.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/backup.png\" alt=\"backup\" width=\"500\"/>  We now can remove the `.anaconda_backup` by typing `rm -rf .anaconda_backup`. Then press `Enter`.  \n",
    "4. Edit the `.bash_profile`.   \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/bash_profile.png\" alt=\"bash_profile\" width=\"750\"/>  Next we need to edit our `.bash_profile` to remove Anaconda references. To open the file type `open -a TextEdit .bash_profile` and press `Enter` this will open the file in `TextEdit`.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/bash_export.png\" alt=\"bash_export\" width=\"500\"/>  First you will want to delete the line, *if it exists*, that says `export PATH=[MAYBE_DIFFERENT_FOR_YOUR_SYSTEM]/anaconda3/bin:PATH`. Note that it may be different for your system but you are looking for something generally like this.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/path.png\" alt=\"path\" width=\"500\"/>  Next we will need to note the path to the Anaconda3 folder. You can see this here in the file. We can copy this path to our clipboard by pressing <kbd> command </kbd> + <kbd> c </kbd>.  Be sure to copy only up to the end of `anaconda3`.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/bash_init.png\" alt=\"bash_init\" width=\"500\"/>  Now we will need to delete the `conda initalize` block.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/bash_done.png\" alt=\"done\" width=\"500\"/>  The file should now be cleared of what is needed. (*Note: If you are on on macOS Catalina notice the last line in this file. This is what you need to silence the warning you get when booting up the Terminal if you are using `bash` (which is what was recommended). You can put this line in there if you would like to silence this warning*)\n",
    "5. Using the path that you copied from the previous, we need to delete `Anaconda3` folder.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/delete.png\" alt=\"delete\" width=\"500\"/>  Go back to the terminal and type the following `rm -rf ` then press <kbd> command </kbd> + <kbd> v </kbd>. When done it should look like the following `rm -rf /Users/brandonmcintyre/me/anaconda3`, but be aware the path that was copied over will be different for you. Then press `Enter`. This might take a few moments to run, be paitent.\n",

    "1. Make sure Anaconda is broken by trying to open `Anaconda-Navigator`.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/broken.png\" alt=\"broken\" width=\"500\"/> Using Spotlight by pressing <kbd> command </kbd> + <kbd> space-bar </kbd> or simply use the search bar in the top right corner search `Anaconda-Navigator` and press `Enter`. If you recive this prompt, your Anaconda is broken.  \n",

Using Spotlight by pressing <kbd> command </kbd> + <kbd> space-bar </kbd> or simply use the search bar in the top right corner search `terminal` and press `Enter`. If you *do not* see the warning, and the top of the terminal says something like this `[YOUR_USERNAME_HERE] - -zsh - [SIZE_OF_WINDOW]` skip to the next step [2a](#2a).  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/terminal_bash.png\" alt=\"terminal_bash\" width=\"500\"/> The warning means that the default \"shell\" terminal macOS Catalina uses has changed from `bash` to `zsh`. The \"shell\" is basically the program you give commands to that gives commands to the computer. This warning will always pop up everytime terminal is started. You can do a few things about this: do nothing, [remove the warning](https://www.saintlad.com/hide-default-interactive-shell-is-now-zsh-in-terminal-on-macos/), or change your shell to `zsh` at your own risk as we will be using `bash` in this course. (If you do change your shell it will change the configuration files you use, which if you [follow this guide](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh-part-2-configuration-files/) you can transfer the `.bashrc` and like files to the appropiate `.zshrc` like files. If you want to change back to the `bash` shell you can run the command `chsh -s /bin/bash`.) Move to step 3 after deciding on your option.  \n",
    "    <a id=\"2a\"></a>\n",
    "    **2a.** <img src=\"./images_mac/terminal_zsh.png\" alt=\"terminal_zsh\" width=\"500\"/> Currently, you are running the `zsh` shell. This is either because you changed it yourself, or you created a new user account on a MAC that is running macOS Catalina. The \"shell\" is basically the program you give commands to that gives commands to the computer. You may stay on this shell at your at your own risk as we will be using the `bash` shell in this course. (If you *do not* change your shell you will be using different configuration files, which if you [follow this guide](https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh-part-2-configuration-files/) you can transfer `.bashrc` settings and like files to the appropiate `.zshrc` settings and like files).  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/terminal_zsh_change.png\" alt=\"terminal_zsh_change\" width=\"500\"/> If you want to change to the `bash` shell you can type `chsh -s /bin/bash` in the Terminal and pressing `Enter`. You will then be prompted to enter the password to the user account. Then close and re-open terminal and you should notice the warning in which case you can go back to step 2.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Move the `Anaconda-Navigator` in the `Applications` folder into the trash.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/anaconda-trash.png\" alt=\"anaconda-trash\" width=\"500\"/> Open up `finder` and navigate to the `Applications` folder by clicking on the folder in the navigation pane on the left hand side of the `finder` window. Then click and drag the `Anaconda-Navigator` to the `Trash` in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. If `Anaconda-Navigator` is also in your dock, you can also move that to the `trash`.\n",

    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/t_sbs.png\" alt=\"t_sbs\" width=\"750\"/>  Open terminal on your computer by using Spotlight by pressing <kbd> command </kbd> + <kbd> space-bar </kbd> or simply use the search bar in the top right corner search `terminal` and press `Enter`. Then re-size the window and move the `Finder` window around until you have both side-by-side. In the `Finder` click on the newly availible home folder tab. You should see all the folders in this picture.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/t_col.png\" alt=\"t_col\" width=\"500\"/>  In the finder window enable column-view by clicking on the column-view button on the top of the finder.\n",
    "2. Use `ls` to list all the contents of the directory/folder\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/t_ls.png\" alt=\"t_ls\" width=\"800\"/> Now in the teriminal type `ls` and press `Enter`. The `ls` command lists all the contents of the directory/folder. You can see now that folder terminal starts in, is this folder that is open in the `Finder`. If you want, you can play around with this and see all of the folders you have access to from this folder by clicking on the folders/directories in the `Finder` window. You will notice that as you click on folders/directories and files the `Path Bar` on the bottom of the `Finder` window we set up earilier will change as your \"path\" changes.\n",
    "3. Notice the terminal and change directory to `Downloads`.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/t_term.png\" alt=\"t_term\" width=\"500\"/>  Take a look and you will notice that on the same line where you input your commands there is the same repeating line `(base) [COMPUTER_NAME]:[LOCATION] [USERNAME]`\\$. For reference the image above shows this computer having the line `(base) CMSE-Air-11:~ brandonmcintyre`\\$. The `(base)` is referring to the fact that the `conda` enviroment is running. This comes from the use of `Anaconda` and having this `conda` `(base)` running allows us to useful commands from `Anaconda`. For our purposes we can keep this enviroment active with no issues, but if you ever needed to deactivate the enviroment for any reason you can use the command `conda deactivate`. You will notice the `(conda)` will disappear meaning you are out of the enviroment. However, please note in order to use Anconda and its tools you will need this enviroment activated. In order to re-activate the Anaconda enviroment, run the the command `conda activate`. The rest of the line you can match up to the template. `[COMPUTER_NAME]` = `CMSE-Air-11`, `[LOCATION]` = `~` (which we know is short for the home directory), `[USERNAME]` = `brandonmcintyre`.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/t_down.png\" alt=\"t_down\" width=\"500\"/>  Now we will use the `cd` command to \"change directory\" to the `Downloads` folder. To change the directory/folder to the `Downloads` folder we just need to type `cd Downloads` and press `Enter`. Notice a few things. *First*, You may be prompted to allow `Terminal.app` to have access to the `Downloads` folder, allow this. *Second*, that when typing `Downloads` if you were to hit the `Tab` key on the keyboard after typing `Down` it would auto-complete to `Downloads/`. This is a feature of the command line that will prove very useful as it can look at all the files in the directory you are in (or going to) and auto-complete if it finds the match. *Finally*, notice how the `[LOCATION]` change from `~` to `Downloads`. This is letting you know that you are now in the a new directory/folder.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/t_jup_b.png\" alt=\"t_jup_b\" width=\"500\"/>  You can see all the files in the `Downloads` directory/folder by running the command `ls` and press `Enter`. Here, you may notice that in the photo there is a `.ipynb` in this directory. We can actually start up jupyter notebook in this directory from our terminal and open this file if we wish. You can do this by running the command `jupyter notebook`  and pressing `Enter`. This will open Jupyter Notebook in your current directory/folder (The `Downloads` folder).  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/t_jup.png\" alt=\"t_jup\" width=\"750\"/>  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/t_jup_c.png\" alt=\"t_jup_c\" width=\"500\"/>  To close down Jupyter Notebooks close the browser and then type <kbd> control </kbd> + <kbd> c </kbd> twice in a row. *Note: You can go back to the home directory/folder by typing `cd ..` and pressing `Enter`. The `..` means \"parent\" directory/folder. Which just means the folder that the current folder belongs to. So the `Downloads` directory/folder belongs to the home directory/folder.*\n",

    "<a id=\"mac_path\"></a>  \n",
    "**Setting up Terminal to Show Full Path**  \n",
    "As seen in the above section, when you change directories (folders) the terminal will display the name of the directory (folder) but not the full path (you will learn later in class what path means). This may not be apperent if you have not used terminal before, as showing the full path is a common thing to see when using other unix command lines. To enable this we just need to make a simple edit to your `.bash_profile`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open terminal and open up `.bash_profile`.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/path_open.png\" alt=\"path_open\" width=\"500\"/>  Open terminal on your computer by using Spotlight by pressing <kbd> command </kbd> + <kbd> space-bar </kbd> or simply use the search bar in the top right corner search `terminal` and press `Enter`. Then in the terminal type `open -a TextEdit .bash_profile` and press `Enter` on the keyboard.\n",
    "2. Add `export PS1='\\u@\\H:\\w$` just before `# >>> conda initalize >>`  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/path_profile.png\" alt=\"path_profile\" width=\"500\"/>  Using the text editor, place this exact command `export PS1='\\u@\\H:\\w$` just before `# >>> conda initalize >>`. This is very important that it comes before the `conda intilaize` block of code. Also it may try to autocorrect `export` to `Export`, this is not correct it needs to be lowercase. You may need to add a few lines using `Enter` in order to get the spacing as it is above. Once done you can simply close out of the TextEdit window.  \n",
    "3. Close the terminal and reopen terminal.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images_mac/path_test.png\" alt=\"path_profile\" width=\"500\"/> Closing the terminal and reopening it should yeild something like the above. You might not notice anything different. However, like we did above, \"change directory\" by typing `cd Downloads` and pressing `Enter` on the keyboard. Now you should see, how unlike before, you see your location in relation to the home folder `~/Downloads`. This will prove very useful later on in class.\n",

    "# Course Communication with Slack\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Slack ([http://slack.com](http://slack.com)) as our means of communicating about course content as the semester progresses. We believe that this will provide an excellent avenue to have discussions not only with course instructors, TAs, and LAs, but also between you and your fellow classmates. In order to join the Slack team that we’ve created for the course you should complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [https://cmse-courses.slack.com/signup](https://cmse-courses.slack.com/signup)\n",
    "2. Once there, sign up using your @msu.edu email address.\n",
    "\t**Important**: When you create your account, use your \tMSU NetID as your user name. This will make it easier for your instructors to recognize you within the Slack channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've joined the CMSE Courses Slack team, you'll need to **add yourself to two channels**. The first channel you should add yourself to is **\"cmse202-f20-help\"**. The second one you should add yourself to is **\"cmse202-###-f20\"** where \"###\" corresponds to the section of the course that you are enrolled in. To add yourself to these channels, click on \"Channels\" and search for the appropriate channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"help\" channel will be the place to go for any questions about assignments in the course or issues you're having with your computer or Python. We encourage you to help out other classmates when you can! The section-specific channel will be used by your instructor for important messages relevant only to your section of the course.\n",

    "If you want a more streamlined experince, feel free to [download slack for desktop](https://slack.com/downloads/windows). \n",
    "<a id=\"rules\"></a>\n",
    "### Slack usage rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that Slack is a useful tool that does not become overly time-consuming for the course instructors, TAs, or LAs, we have a list of rules for how we expect you to use Slack. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before you ask a question, be sure to check the other section channels to see if the question has already been answered.\n",
    "2. The Slack team is primarily for you, the students, so help each other.\n",
    "3. The TAs and LAs will monitor the channels, but will defer to the students to work through things. They will only enter a conversation if students are going down the wrong path and/or there are too few other students involved. However, you should not expect that the TAs or LAs will always be available. The TAs and LAs will spend a limited amount of time “logged in” to Slack and we ask that you be respectful of their time.\n",
    "4. Slack is meant to be used to help you when you are stuck with a minor issue. If you are having major issues or trouble understanding the concept, go to office/helproom hours.  Office/helproom hours are meant for more in-depth discussions of course content.\n",
    "5. Course instructors will rarely check Slack, only to examine progress. While they may offer help, do not rely on it. Instructors will not respond to the same student twice within a 30 minute time interval.\n",
    "6. Only in rare cases should you contact an instructor through a private channel. But, if you are struggling, feel free to use this option.\n",
    "7. **Do not** post your solutions to out-of-class assignments directly into Slack unless prompted by an instructor.\n",
    "8. Be courteous to everyone on Slack. Students who are being rude or who are excessively posting might be banned from posting on the course Slack channel."
