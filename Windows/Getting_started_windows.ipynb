Also, the `Backspace` still does work, so don't be afraid to use it if you fear you have made a mistake.* Once you have created your password (and you are sure you entered it in correctly), press `Enter`.

What this command does is download (`curl`) the file `Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh` from the website `https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh` without the need to rename it (`-O`). The link provided is simply found by visiting the Anaconda's download page and copying the link to the Linux install for Python 3.X that is `64-bit`. *Note: You can copy and paste into the the Terminal by first copying the text in this notebook. Then on the terminal, left-click to engage the window and right-click to paste*.\n",

This will run the anaconda installer in your terminal. Notice the file itself is what is known as a \"script\" - denoted by the `.sh` file ending. The command `Bash` is used to run the script. *Note: When typing, to save you time you can you use what is known as \"tab complete\". To try this out type `bash Ana` and then press the `Tab` key. This should auto fill the rest of the file name.*  \n",

    "    <img src=\"./images/conda_wsl_g.png\" alt=\"conda_wsl_g\" width=\"500\"/>  Anaconda should now be successfully installed! To test this out, close the terminal window by typing `exit` and press `Enter`. Then open up Ubuntu again via the search bar (<kbd> Windows-key </kbd> and search for `Ubuntu`) or the taskbar if you pinned it to your taskbar earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test Anaconda Installation.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/base.png\" alt=\"base\" width=\"500\"/>  If you started up Ubuntu again and if all went well, you will notice the `(conda)` in the terminal that was not there before. This is saying that you are now running in the Anaconda Enviroment (much like what you were using when using the `Anaconda Prompt` when running in Windows 10).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/activate.png\" alt=\"base_activate\" width=\"500\"/>  For our purposes we can keep this enviroment active with no issues, but if you ever needed to deactivate the enviroment for any reason you can use the command `conda deactivate`. You will notice the `(conda)` will disappear meaning you are out of the enviroment. However, please note in order to use Anconda and its tools you will need this enviroment activated. In order to re-activate the Anaconda enviroment, run the the command `conda activate`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/ipython.png\" alt=\"ipython\" width=\"500\"/>  To test our installation further, type `ipython` in the terminal and press `Enter`. This will run what is known as the \"iPython interpreter\", which essentially means you are running a program that runs python code from the terminal. If everything goes well your terminal should look like this. Additionally, you can test out ipython by trying `import numpy as np`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/close.png\" alt=\"close\" width=\"500\"/>  To close out of the \"iPython interpreter\" you will need to press <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> d </kbd>. A prompt should then come up asking if you want to exit. To confirm type `y` and press `Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Update Anaconda and all of its packages.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/update.png\" alt=\"update\" width=\"500\"/>  Even though you may have sucessfully installed Anaconda, we still need to update all of the packages Anaconda comes with. To do this, in terminal type `conda update --all` and press `Enter`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/update_y.png\" alt=\"update_y\" width=\"500\"/>  To confirm and proceed, type `y` and press `Enter`.\n",

    "    <img src=\"./images/update_done.png\" alt=\"update_done\" width=\"500\"/>  The update is now complete.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Remove the Anaconda Installer to free space.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/remove.png\" alt=\"remove\" width=\"500\"/>  With everything installed and up to date, you can now safetly delete the Installer Script file to save some space on your computer. To do this type `cd ~` and press `Enter` to make sure you are in your home directory. Then type `rm Ana` and press the `Tab` key to auto-complete to `rm Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh`. Then press `Enter`. The `rm` is the command to delete in unix-like systems.\n",

    "2. Run Jupyter Notebook from terminal\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/no_browser.png\" alt=\"no_browser\" width=\"500\"/>  In the terminal, type `jupyter notebook --no-browser` and then press `Enter`. The terminal will display multiple lines of text stating that it has started the Jupyter Notebook server. The inclusion of the \"flag\" `--no-browser` is to tell the system to not automatically open a web browser (which is what the Windows 10 version of jupyter notebook would do). The reason WSL cannot do this is because of two reasons. The first is that there is no web browser installed in this version of Ubuntu. The second, is that currently WSL is not setup to display any sort of Graphical User Interface (GUI). However, if you are up to the challenge, [you can get around this](https://gist.github.com/kauffmanes/5e74916617f9993bc3479f401dfec7da#gistcomment-3121935). These things can be accomplished, but much work would need to be done and is out of the scope of this class. *Note: It is possible to run the `jupyter notebook` command without the `--no-browser` flag. You will just notice that an error will be given in the terminal, but the program will still have all functionality.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![notebook](./images/notebook.png)  Copy the link provided by the terminal and paste it into the web browser of your choice. You can copy text from the terminal by click and dragging over the text to select it, then pressing <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> c </kbd> which will copy it. Then in a web browser of your choice, paste the copied URL into the address bar and press `Enter`. *Note: When running a notebook like this the terminal will be occupied. If you need to use the terminal for anything while using this, you will simply just need to open another Ubuntu terminal.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/close_note.png\" alt=\"close_note\" width=\"500\"/>  To close the notebook, close the tabs in the web broswer. Then in the terminal, type <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> c </kbd> twice in a row (you may need to do this with a slight delay between commands).\n",

    "Throughout this course you will be downloading many notebooks and files. When it comes to the WSL, the directory you start your session in, known as the \"home directory\", is not easy to get to in the file explorer from Windows 10. However, thankfully common windows tools are actually baked in to WSL. We will utilize this feature to create a shortcut to the WSL home directory in your file explorer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up the Ubuntu terminal, and type `cd ~` and press `Enter` to make sure you are at your home directory (`~`). This command will \"change your directory\" (`cd`) to the home directory.  \n",

    "**WSL to Windows 10 User Folder**  \n",
    "When starting WSL and Ubunutu terminal, you techincally reside in part of your hard drive that is not apart of the Windows 10 file system. Above, we saw how to access this area with Windows 10, but here we will see how to access Windows 10 files from WSL. Particually, we will set up easy access to the Windows 10 folder that our friends with Git Bash (those that do not have windows 10) would call there \"home\" directory. This directory/folder is an important folder in windows 10 as it gives access to your desktop, downloads folder, documents folder, and many more folders you may use. To do this we will create what is known as an `alias` in your `.bashrc` file that links to this folder. An `alias` is a fancy name for a \"text shortcut\" that can be used in the terminal. The `.bashrc` is a settings file that your terminal uses to customize your terminal experince.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up the Ubuntu terminal, and type `cd ~` and press `Enter` to make sure you are at your home directory (`~`). This command will \"change your directory\" (`cd`) to the home directory.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the C drive and go to the `Users` Directory. \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/users.png\" alt=\"users\" width=\"500\"/> Type the command `cd /mnt/c/Users` and press `Enter`. This \"changes directory\" (`cd`) to the `Users` directory/folder. Notice the `/mnt/c` means that you are now in the `c` drive. The `c` drive is the drive that Windows 10 is installed, meaning that from this point on you will be accessing files that are accessible on Windows 10.\n",
    "3. Print the directory/folder contents and navigate to the folder that is your Username.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/users_ls.png\" alt=\"users_ls\" width=\"500\"/>  Type `ls` and press `Enter`. In the terminal you will see a list of folders and files. Notice that there is a folder that has your Username for Windows. In my case this is `nodnarb13`.   \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/user_home.png\" alt=\"user_home\" width=\"500\"/>  Using your username you will need to type `cd [USERNAME]` where in place of `[USERNAME]` you put the username you determined for last step. In the case of my computer this would be `cd nodnarb13`. Note as well you have a space in your username there may be `''` around your name.  \n",
    "4. Save the path to the User directory, and navigate back to the Home directory.  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/pwd.png\" alt=\"pwd\" width=\"500\"/>  In the terminal type `pwd`. Then copy the results of the command by clicking and dragging over the text and pressing <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> c </kbd> to copy the highlighted text. If successful the text should become un-highlighted.  \n",

Using your mouse , in the terminal window *right-click* this should then paste the path you copied earlier to line you are typing on. Then finally type `'`. If all went well you should have `alias win_usr='cd [PATH_YOU_PASTED]'`. In my case this looks like `alias win_usr='cd /mnt/c/Users/nonarb13`.  *Note: If any of the lines besides the one you just created were altered, this could break things. Make sure you did not alter any other lines before continuing. If you did happen to mess them up, press `Esc` on the keyboard and then type `:q!` and press `Enter` this will not save any of the changes you made, and you can try editing `.bashrc` again.*\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/save.png\" alt=\"save\" width=\"500\"/>  To save and close the file we will need to return back to the \"Command Mode\" to do this press the `Esc` on your keyboard. You will notice the bottom left-hand corner will go from `-- INSERT --` to *blank*. Then type on your keyboard `:wq` and press enter. This is the command to save (or *write* to the disk `w`) and to quit the text editor (`q`).  \n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/source.png\" alt=\"source\" width=\"500\"/>  In the terminal, type `source .bashrc` and press `Enter`. This will apply the changes we made to the file. If you encounter an error it is most likely you did not close your `'` in your alias. You can reopen the file again with `vi .bashrc` and check to see if you spot an error.  \n",
    "6. Test the alias.\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/win_usr.png\" alt=\"win_usr\" width=\"500\"/>  In the terminal try out the command by typing `win_usr` and pressing `Enter`. If all went well you will notice your location change to the appropiate folder.  \n",

Making sure we know where we are at is crucial to this process. When Opening Git Bash it is likely you will start in one of two places. Either the root directory signified by `/` or your home directory signified by `~`. If you followed the instructions in the `Changing startup location to Home directory` you should always load into the Home (`~`) directory. In this course, we will never need to do anything with the root (`/`) directory as this is a where important files for Git Bash live. To see where you start up in a more familiar program, we will be utilizng the Windows file explorer command inside of the Git Bash terminal.\n",

What this will do will allow WSL to display GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) on your computer screen from the WSL. This is essential for running Spyder and other linux programs that may utilize a GUI interface.

    "We will be using Slack ([http://slack.com](http://slack.com)) as our means of communicating about course content as the semester progresses. We believe that this will provide an excellent avenue to have discussions not only with course instructors, TAs, and LAs, but also between you and your fellow classmates. In order to join the Slack team that we’ve created for the course you should complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [https://cmse-courses.slack.com/signup](https://cmse-courses.slack.com/signup)\n",
    "2. Once there, sign up using your @msu.edu email address.\n",
    "\t**Important**: When you create your account, use your \tMSU NetID as your user name. This will make it easier for your instructors to recognize you within the Slack channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've joined the CMSE Courses Slack team, you'll need to **add yourself to two channels**. The first channel you should add yourself to is **\"cmse202-f20-help\"**. The second one you should add yourself to is **\"cmse202-###-f20\"** where \"###\" corresponds to the section of the course that you are enrolled in. To add yourself to these channels, click on \"Channels\" and search for the appropriate channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"help\" channel will be the place to go for any questions about assignments in the course or issues you're having with your computer or Python. We encourage you to help out other classmates when you can! The section-specific channel will be used by your instructor for important messages relevant only to your section of the course.\n",

    "<a id=\"rules\"></a>\n",
    "### Slack usage rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that Slack is a useful tool that does not become overly time-consuming for the course instructors, TAs, or LAs, we have a list of rules for how we expect you to use Slack. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before you ask a question, be sure to check the other section channels to see if the question has already been answered.\n",
    "2. The Slack team is primarily for you, the students, so help each other.\n",
    "3. The TAs and LAs will monitor the channels, but will defer to the students to work through things. They will only enter a conversation if students are going down the wrong path and/or there are too few other students involved. However, you should not expect that the TAs or LAs will always be available. The TAs and LAs will spend a limited amount of time “logged in” to Slack and we ask that you be respectful of their time.\n",
    "4. Slack is meant to be used to help you when you are stuck with a minor issue. If you are having major issues or trouble understanding the concept, go to office/helproom hours.  Office/helproom hours are meant for more in-depth discussions of course content.\n",
    "5. Course instructors will rarely check Slack, only to examine progress. While they may offer help, do not rely on it. Instructors will not respond to the same student twice within a 30 minute time interval.\n",
    "6. Only in rare cases should you contact an instructor through a private channel. But, if you are struggling, feel free to use this option.\n",
    "7. **Do not** post your solutions to out-of-class assignments directly into Slack unless prompted by an instructor.\n",
    "8. Be courteous to everyone on Slack. Students who are being rude or who are excessively posting might be banned from posting on the course Slack channel."
